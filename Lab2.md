# Lab Task Python
Project 2 - Number Guessing Game
#### Topics covered : 
Loops, Random Module, User Input, Conditional Statements
#### Tools Needed : 
Python 3.x
#### Duration: 
1-2 hours
#### Prerequisites: 
Basic Python, random module, loops.
#### Task:
Build a number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number, and the player guesses it.

The game should give feedback ("too high" or "too low") after each guess and count the number of attempts.
#### Steps:
Use the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 100.

Ask the player to input guesses and compare them to the generated number.

Give hints if the guess is too high or too low.

Track and display the number of attempts when the player guesses the correct number
