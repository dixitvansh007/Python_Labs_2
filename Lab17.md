# Lab Task Python

### Project 17 - Music Playlist Generator
#### Topics covered:
    1. Spotify API Authentication:
   - Authorization via OAuth 2.0.
   - Setting up the `Spotipy` library.
    2. API Interaction
   - How to interact with Spotify's Web API for searching and creating playlists.
    3. Data Handling:
   - Parsing JSON responses from the API.
   - Manipulating data to suit the playlist creation.
    4. Web Interface:
   - Using Django to create a simple web interface to take user input and display the playlist.

#### Tools Needed: 
Python, Spotipy (Spotify API wrapper for Python), Django (for web interface), JSON (for handling API responses)

#### Duration: 
3 - 4 hours

#### Prerequisites: 
    1. Python Programming:
   - Functions, loops, conditionals
   - Working with external libraries and APIs
    2. API Integration:
   - How to make HTTP requests in Python (e.g., using `requests` or using a specific API wrapper like Spotipy)
   - JSON format and parsing
    3. Spotify API:
   - Authentication process via OAuth 2.0
   - Understanding of Spotify endpoints (search, recommendations, tracks)

#### Task:
creating a Python application that uses the Spotify API to generate playlists based on user input. The user can provide a genre, mood, or specific songs, and the application will fetch songs from Spotify's catalog to generate a personalized playlist.

### Steps of Solution:
    
    1. Step 1: Set up the environment
       - Install necessary libraries.
    2. Create a Spotify Developer Account and Set Up Application
    3. Authentication with Spotify
    4. Fetching Music Based on User Input
       - Define a function to fetch songs based on genre, mood, or specific track name.
    5. Create Playlist
       - Define a function to create a playlist and add tracks to it.
    6. Combining Everything
       - Combine the functions in a way that the user provides input (genre, mood, etc.), and the application fetches songs and creates a playlist.
       - Implement error handling to ensure smooth interaction with the API.
    7. Web Interface
